# School_District_Analysis
Python/Pandas

Overview
The Purpose of this analysis was to show a larger view of the school districts metrics. Ranging from the top performing schools to the bottom performing schools. as well as factoring budgets, school sizes, grade level performance and etc.

Results 
The biggest change in math and reading scores was when we removed the 9th grade scores from Thomas Highschool.
The overall district results were not affected significally. 


Summary 
Based on the results the average reading and math scores as well as the overall passing schores are directly reflected on budget spent. 
Even while factoring the fact that we removed the 9th grade studens from Thomas Highschool. the amount of students removed (roughly 500 students) did not have a large enough impact on the overall data due to the fact that we still have 39,000 students to analyize.
